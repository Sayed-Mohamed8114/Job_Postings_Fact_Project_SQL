### the question i answered through my sql queries were :

1. what are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. what skills are required fro these top-paying jobs?
3. what skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. what are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools i used

for my deep dive into the data analysis job market, i harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: the backbone of my analysis , allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: the chosen database management system , ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis , ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
here's how i approached each question :

### 1.top paying Data Analyst jobs

to identify the highest-paying roles , i filtered the data anlyst positions by average yearly salary and location , focusing on remote jobs. this query highlights the high paying opportinuities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id ,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim on job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location='Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg Desc
LIMIT 10 ;
```

here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023 :

- **Wide salary range:** top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000 ,including significant salary potential in the field.

### 2.top paying job skills

Objective: To analyze how specific skills contribute to high-paying roles across different companies and job titles.

```sql
with top_paying_jobs as(
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name as company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
where
     job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
     job_location='Anywhere' AND
     salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
limit 10
)
select
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
from top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
inner join skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg Desc;
```

- **Skill Combinations Matter:** High-paying roles like AT&T's Associate Director ($255,830) require diverse skill stacks including SQL, Python, cloud platforms, and big data tools.

- **Industry-Specific Demands:** Pinterest's Marketing Data Analyst role values Hadoop alongside SQL and Python, while healthcare roles emphasize Crystal and Oracle.
